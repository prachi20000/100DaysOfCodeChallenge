PROBLEM:There are N jobs and the start and finish time of the jobs are given in arrays start[] and end[] respectively. 
Each job requires one laptop and laptops can't be shared. Find the minimum number of laptops required given that you can give your laptop to someone else 
when you are not doing your job.

LANGUAGE: JAVA

SOL:
class Solution {
    public int minLaptops(int N, int[] start, int[] end) {
        Arrays.sort(start);
    Arrays.sort(end);
    
    int total = 1;
    for(int i = 1, j = 0; i < N && j < N; i++){
        if(start[i] < end[j]){
            total += 1;
        }
        else{
            j++;
        }
    }
    return total;

    }
}

TEST CASE 1
Input:
N = 3
start[] = {1, 2, 3}
end[] = {4, 4, 6}
Output:
3
Explanation:
We can clearly see that everyone's supposed to
be doing their job at time 3. So, 3 laptops
will be required at minimum.

TEST CASE 2
Input:
N = 3
start[] = {1, 5, 2}
end[] = {2, 6, 3}
Output :
1
Explanation:
All jobs can be done using 1 laptop only.
