PROBLEM:Write a multithreading program in JAVA to perform the following task
   -Display all numbers between 1 to 100 which are divisible by 7 and 11
   -Display all numbers between 1 to 100 which are divisible by either 5 or 13
   
LANGUAGE: JAVA

SOL:
package lab_test;
import java.util.*;

class number extends Thread{
	
	public void run() {
	for(int i=0;i<=100;i++) {
		if(i%7==0 && i%11==0)
		{
			System.out.println("Number divisible by 7 and 11 both are " +i);
		}
	}
}
}

class number1 extends Thread{
	public void run() {
		for(int j=0;j<100;j++) {
			if(j%5==0 || j%13==0)
			{
				System.out.println("Number divisible by 5 or 13 are " +j);
			}
		}
	}
}

public class Q2 {
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		number n1=new number();
		number1 n2=new number1();
		n1.start();
		n2.start();
		
	}

}
