PROBLEM: 1)Write a RegEx that will match any repeated word.
2)Complete the second compile argument so that the compiled RegEx is case-insensitive.
3)Write the two necessary arguments for replaceAll such that each repeated word is replaced with the very first instance 
the word found in the sentence. It must be the exact first occurrence of the word, as the expected output is case-sensitive.
